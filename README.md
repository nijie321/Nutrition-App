# Nutrition-App! (COMP4882 Capstone Team B)
## Problem Statements
Over the last 40 years, food consumption has changed from a whole foods type dietary pattern to food that is convenient and affordable. This was mostly driven by the change in work habits, where people started working longer hours and mothers, who tended to be the person taking care of food and health of the family, also joined the labor force. Industry responded accordingly and produced food products that were convenient, but not necessarily focused on health. This led to the current food environment where energy-dense, nutrient deprived convenience foods have become the staple, while whole food consumption is reduced mostly due to limited availability and time for preparation. If efforts can be made to produce economical, well balanced healthy meals with a mixture of nutrient dense foods in alignment with the current dietary guidelines in a similarly convenient fashion, the healthy choice may become the preferred choice and possibly have a carry-over effect influencing healthier families. 

The purpose of this application is to help busy working individuals/families reduce the time spent on preparing foods. In particular, and more generally, it will allow users to order affordable and convenient healthy meals that are easy to prepare on their own.
